//! The faces of a `Polyhedron` for external consumption. Each face is a planar polygon in
//! principle although floating point imprecision may make it not so in practice for faces
//! of more than three vertices.
//!
//! This module is not for the slicing or dicing of `Polyhedron` faces to carry out the
//! Conway operations. That is handled inside the `polyhedron` module. This is simply for
//! consumption of a finished `Polyhedron` by other systems.
//!
//! The slicing this module does is to turn a non-triangular polygon into a series of
//! triangles expressed as all the vertices of the face in addition to an index delineating
//! the order to traverse the vertices tracing out triangles that cover the entire face.
